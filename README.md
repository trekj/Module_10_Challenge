# Crypto Clustering
In this Python project, we are going to use financial python programming with the unsupervised learning to creating a machine learning model that groups cryptocurrencies to assemble investment portfolios that are based on the profitability of those cryptocurrencies.
## Technologies
This project is written in ***Python 3.8*** with the following libraries:

***panda*** -a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

***sklearn*** -Scikit-Learn is a free machine learning library for Python. It supports both supervised and unsupervised machine learning, providing diverse algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The library is built using many libraries you may already be familiar with, such as NumPy and SciPy. It also plays well with other libraries, such as Pandas and Seaborn.

***hvplot*** - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

import pandas as pd

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from path import Path

import hvplot.pandas


## Usage

After cloning the repository,  open the directory Starter Code and run the program by typing python crypto_investments.ipynb
